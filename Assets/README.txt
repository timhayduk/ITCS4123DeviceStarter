So far, I've created all 48 contiguous states as 3D objects from sprites. Unfortunately, there were no
ready-made examples where someone had split out the states indivivdually, so I had to do that by hand.
I ended up using a paid asset package (2D Tilezone) to generate the 3D shapes from 2D, so I've not included
that source in the shared files. As a result, I will work on altering the heights/colors based on amounts
released next, I just wanted to get this out to you so you could start playing with it.

NOTE: Washington and Oregon are a work-in-progress. For some reason, those two won't generate the walls like 
the rest of the states....

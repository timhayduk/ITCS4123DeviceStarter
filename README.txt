For our Device Starter, we decided to stick with the same data set from our Data Starter, 
which was the EPA Releases set.

We decided to use VR to create our visualization, using Unity to create a 3D map of the 48 contiguous
United States. This map was raised and colored based on the amount of releases in each state.

For interaction, we have allowed the user to look at and click on a state. This will bring up two bar graphs:
one to the left of the states with the top 10 chemicals released in that state, and one to the right with 
the top 10 industry sectors that recorded releases in that state.
